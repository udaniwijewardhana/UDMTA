# UDMTA

## Shiny App for Annual Species Temporal Abundance Models 

The study of data collected consecutively across time is referred to as time series analysis. A discrete domain (e.g., years) or a continuous domain (e.g., days) can be used to index time. Users can use this app to fit temporal models to identify the significant explanatory variables and the trends of the species during a span of years. The app would use most common distributions for species such as "Poisson" and "Negative Binomial" as well as the zero inflation distributions. First the user needs to upload the data csv file with or without explanatory variables (numeric/factor) into the application and then user must select whether the numeric data should be normalized or not. This is conducted using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). INLA is popular as an approximation tool for fitting Bayesian models. INLA is an alternative robust method for the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Bayesian analyses (Paul et al. 2010). The key advantages of INLA are the ease with which complex models can be created and modified, without the need to write complex code, and the speed at which inference can be done even for spatial problems with hundreds of thousands of observations (Sarul, 2015).

There is an acknowledged need to combine species distribution and macro-ecological models with phylogenetic information, particularly when biogeographic research incorporates multiple species. Users can use UDMTA to multispecies data or single species data using R-INLA. To know if the rate at which abundance is changing over time differs according to a relevant predictor variable, we have included the facility to add interaction terms between any two predictor variables in our regression models. The interaction with a categorical variable tells us what the difference in slope is and whether this difference is significant.

### Input File

The data file should include only:
  1. Species - Different species
2. Year - Detected Year
3. Count - Species count
with or without predictor variables (numeric/factor). The above names are case sensitive. A sample format of the data can be found in https://github.com/uwijewardhana/UDMTA.

## Installation Instructions

- Download the https://github.com/uwijewardhana/UDMTA/ repository zip folder and extract and run the app on your r console.

```r
shiny::runGitHub( "UDMTA", "uwijewardhana") 
```
- User can access the standard R-repository to download and install package R-INLA by http://www.r-inla.org/download.
