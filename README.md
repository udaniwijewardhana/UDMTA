# UDMTA

## Shiny App for Species Annual Temporal Abundance Models 

Users can use this app to fit temporal models to identify the significant explanatory variables and the trends of the species during a span of years. The app would use most common distributions for species such as "Poisson" and "Negative Binomial" as well as the zero inflation distributions. First the user needs to upload the data csv file with or without explanatory variables (numeric/factor) into the application and then user must select whether the numeric data should be normalized or not. Categorical predictor variables should not be included as numeric or integer variables. User can include any number of factor or numeric variables.

This is conducted using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA).INLA is popular as an approximation tool for fitting Bayesian models which is an alternative robust method for the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Bayesian analyses (Paul et al. 2010). The key advantages of INLA are the ease with which complex models can be created and modified, without the need to write complex code, and the speed at which inference can be done even for spatial problems with hundreds of thousands of observations (Sarul, 2015).

Users can use UDMTA to fit single species distribution models using R-INLA. To know if the rate at which abundance is changing over time differs according to a relevant predictor variable, we have included the facility to add interaction terms between any two predictor variables in our regression models). Users can also obtain predictions based on the fitted model. This app is suitable to analysis a single area (spatial effect is assumed to be independent and identically distributed). 

### Input File

The data file should include only:
  Year - Detected Year
  Count - Species count
with or without predictor variables (numeric/factor). These names are case sensitive. A sample format of the data can be found in https://github.com/udaniwijewardhana/UDMTA.
Data should be ordered according to factor levels as in sample "Data.csv".

## Installation Instructions

To build this Shiny app, we need to clone the GitHub repository from https://github.com/udaniwijewardhana/UDMTA and save it in our computer. This folder contains a sample Data.CSV file, the vignette and app.R file. Then, we can launch the app by clicking the Run App button at the top of the RStudio editor or by executing runApp("appdir_path")where appdir_path is the path of the directory that contains the app.R file. For this we need to install R and RStudio in our computer. User can download and install package R-INLA by  http://www.r-inla.org/download.
